### Proxy configuration for axios

If you need to set proxy for remote and cloud execution, appium-device-farm will use the proxy provided and pass that to HttpAgent and HttpsAgent.

The proxy object definition will be as per the axios documentation available here - https://axios-http.com/docs/req_config

Example:

```
  proxy: {
    protocol: 'https',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 9000,
    auth: {
      username: 'mikeymike',
      password: 'rapunz3l'
    }
  },
```
